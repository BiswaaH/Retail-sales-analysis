# Retail-sales-analysis
Objectives
1.	Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2.	Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4.	Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

1. Database Setup
•	Database Creation: The project starts by creating a database named Retail_sales_analysis.
•	Table Creation: A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.
2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
•	Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
•	Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
•	Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
•	Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
3. Data Analysis & Findings
The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:
1.  Sales made on 2022-11-05
2.  Clothing sales with quantity > 4 in Nov-2022
3.  Total sales per category
4.  Avg age of Beauty customers
5.  Transactions > 1000
6.  Transactions by gender & category
7.  Best-selling month each year (by avg sale)
8.  Top 5 customers by sales
9.  Unique customers per category
10. Orders by shift

Findings
•	Customer Demographics: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
•	High-Value Transactions: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
•	Sales Trends: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
•	Customer Insights: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

Reports
•	Sales Summary: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
•	Trend Analysis: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
•	Customer Insights: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

Conclusion
This project serves database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
